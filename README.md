## Learning to Rank Tooling

Tooling for doing machine learning to optimize relevance

### Search Engine Plugins

- [Solr Learning to Rank](https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/6_6/learning-to-rank.html) - supports storing and logging features (Solr queries), uploading models, and executing a range of models

### Learning to Rank Training Models

- [RankyMcRankFace](https://github.com/o19s/RankyMcRankFace) - Ranklib fork with a few extra features
- [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - eXtreme Gradient Boosting - scalably train a MART ranking model
- [LightGBM](https://github.com/Microsoft/LightGBM) - Microsoft's gradient boosting library
- [TFRanking](https://github.com/tensorflow/ranking) - Tensorflow ranking

## NLP

- [Gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/) - Topic modeling, and other useful NLP tasks like collocation detection, word2vec, and others

## Analytics

- [Search Collector](https://github.com/searchhub/search-collector) - Collecting behavioral signals from a browser

## Rule Systems

- [Querqy](http://github.com/renekrie/querqy) - Query preprocessing & search rule system for applying query-specific boosts, filters, downboosts, etc (ie downboost 'case' category when user searches for 'iPhone')
- [SMUI](https://github.com/pbartusch/smui) - UI for managing Solr collections, which supports (among other things) managing Quergy rules.
